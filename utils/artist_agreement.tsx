              injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or

              then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by
              calling 1-800- 778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for
              Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a

              Artist is responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If Artist prevails

              from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses

              and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and

              public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent
              jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive
              relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.

            provided in this Agreement or as the Parties may agree in writing. No amendment to this Agreement or waiver
            of any provision hereof will be valid or binding unless reduced to writing and duly executed by the Party or
            Parties to be bound thereby. Failure to promptly enforce a provision of this Agreement will not be construed
            as a waiver of such provision. Nothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed to create, or be construed
            as creating, a joint venture or partnership between the parties. Neither Party is, by virtue of this

            Agreement will be deemed to create any third-party beneficiary right upon any third party whatsoever. Each
            of the Parties acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to have this Agreement reviewed or not by
            independent legal counsel of its choice. If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement should be
            ruled wholly or partly invalid or unenforceable, then the provisions held invalid or unenforceable will be
            deemed amended, and the court or other government body is authorized to reform the provision(s) to the
            minimum extent necessary to render them valid and enforceable in conformity with the parties’ intent as
            manifested herein. The headings to Sections of this Agreement are for convenience or reference only and do
            not form a part of this Agreement and will not in any way affect its interpretation. Neither Party will be
            afforded or denied preference in the construction of this Agreement, whether by virtue of being the drafter
            or otherwise. For purposes of this Agreement, the words and phrases “include,” “includes”, “including” and
            “such as” are deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”. Any notices or other communications
